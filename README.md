# SAT Solvers in Python

## Description
A computational project completed in my 1st year of undergraduate studies as part of a Computer Science module. I wrote SAT solvers in Python and tested them using various pre-prepared DIMACS files. The three SAT solvers produced range from taking a brute-force approach, to applying recursion and the DPLL algorithm.

## Project Files

### Text Files
- `sat.txt`: A basic DIMACS file which should evaluate to SAT


### SAT Solvers
- `simple-sat-solver.py`: 
- `branching-sat-solver.py`:
- `dpll-sat-solver.py`:
